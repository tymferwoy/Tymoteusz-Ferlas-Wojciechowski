                        Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

                    <p>
                        Reboot is a focus and productivity application that helps users limit access to selected 
                        applications during user-initiated focus sessions. The App uses Apple's Screen Time APIs 
                        to provide app blocking functionality.

                    <p>
                        The App requires Screen Time permissions to function. By granting these permissions, 
                        you authorize the App to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block access to apps you select during focus sessions</li>
                        <li>Display shield screens when blocked apps are accessed</li>
                        <li>Manage focus session schedules you create</li>

                    <p>
                        You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device's Settings. Revoking 
                        permissions will disable the App's core functionality.
